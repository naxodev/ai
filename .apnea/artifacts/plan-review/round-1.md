## Findings

No blocking findings.

The plan follows the requested sequence as seven narrow vertical slices. Phase 1 is limited to the installed packed-core Node daemon/client smoke and explicitly preserves the export surface, accepts a structurally supplied unique runtime, delays cleanup until termination is confirmed, and retains/reports the temporary root when process-group termination cannot be confirmed. Its acceptance checks cover the required package-name import, manifest-selected daemon, invalid configuration, hello/replay, provider isolation, awaited disposal, bounded status-zero idle exit, diagnostics, and successful cleanup without importing unrelated host or architecture work.

The remaining phases stay scoped to the exact OpenCode pin, exact Pi pins and peer compatibility, current-architecture documentation, the full repository gate, mixed-host evidence, and the dispatcher-provided PR-description artifact. Each phase has coherent acceptance criteria, dependencies, non-goals, and sane non-destructive verification commands. The plan also preserves the dirty Jujutsu baseline and unrelated changes, assigns squashing only to the orchestrator after approval, and prohibits Git commits, pushes, PR creation, and `.apnea/state.json` edits.
